A fun project, it has improved my knowledge of Test Driven Development (TDD), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Object-Oriented Design (OOD).

The aim was to create a system to organize a weekly kickabout I have with mates. The Mananger(class) has a team(class). This team lists his players and their attributes, which are updated weekly. The app can send out a message to all the players, who are initialized with contact_numbers. The manager can put the team into matches(class) and try to predict who will win based on various factors.
